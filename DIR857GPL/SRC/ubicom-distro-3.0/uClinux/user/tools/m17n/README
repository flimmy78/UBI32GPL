STEP:1
	To get the .txt language file(such as STRINGS_ZH.txt) from Ubicom that you want to support.
	Transfer DoS format to Linux format using this command:
	
	>>dos2unix {file_name} 
	
	Then replace all /" to "

STEP:2
	To the folder --> projects/{model_name}/tools/m17n/
	Then type make to build m17n_tool.
	You can use -h to understand how to use this tool.

	EX:m17n_tool -l EN -c $(PROJECTS_PATH)/tools/m17n/STRINGS_ZH.txt -t $(FS_PATH)/www

	it will create a .js file naming with lingual_XX.js (XX can be EN,TW,KO and JA. It follows by -l option.)        to path. (which follows by -t option)

STEP:3
	Modify $(PROJECTS_PATH)/Makefile. 
	Add the file in STEP:2 and lingual_XX.js in STEP:3 to CVS server.
	Commit them to CVS server.

STEP:4
	Enable M17N function in daemons folder with making menuconfig.
	 
STEP:5 	
	You can skip STEP 1 to 3 when next time you want to build image with supporting multiple languages.
	While making install, Matrix will build  m17n_tool in projects/{model_name}/tools/m17n/.
	If you can not find it,please send email to Me or debug by yourself then commit to CVS server.

	If it works normally, it will create different .js files and install them to the rootfs automatically.





If you have any problem, please email to me.
