# Example topology file

# NOTE! There are complex rules for how "ath" devices may be assigned
# (this is a limitation of the driver).

# All managed wifi devices must be part of a bridge
# In addition, ethernet devices may be part of the bridge.

# Any interfaces to be used but NOT bridged should be included in
# phoney bridge "none"
bridge none
{
    interface ath0
}

# A section for each radio device, identified by it's psuedo-interface name
# wifi0, wifi1 (assuming Atheros wifi chips)... these are assigned by driver.
