This README describes how to program this cgi to your project.

o Directory architecture


Directory arch are 'core', 'asp', 'ext', 'lib'
	core: The core arch of ssi cgi. and _SHOULDE_NOT_  be modified as possible.
	asp: Definition of nvram for each UI pages.
	ext: _MAY_ by prject or module, or customize features...
	lib: shared, independent library

o Rules & style.

	ext: some external function or features. as, x509, syslog,
		firmware upgrade, get/set config...

o do your best.
	In our purpose, We hope this code is flexible, useable, extensible.
	so, you should to review your code in each time after you finish
	your new feature or bugfix.
	in comment, the key word 'XXX' used to meaning 'NOTE: here are some
	issues or how is your algorithm trough ...', the key word 'FIXME' is
	'some work-around code here' we need to fix ASAP. or 'TODO' is used
	to 'There are some better algorithm here, but not be implemet yet'.
