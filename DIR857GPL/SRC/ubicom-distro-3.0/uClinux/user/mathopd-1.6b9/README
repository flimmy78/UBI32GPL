README file for Mathopd/1.6

This is Mathopd, a fast, lightweight, non-forking HTTP server for
UN*X systems.

Please read the file COPYING first before you do anything else.

The src/ directory contains the source files for this
software and a makefile to build everything. The makefile
has instructions that will help you adjust it to build
the software on your specific platform.

The doc/ directory contains some documentation about running
this software. It also has detailed descriptions of all
settings that can be configured.

Mathopd/1.6 is currently BETA quality, which means it may
crash and burn at random intervals. If you need a stable
mathopd, please use the latest version from the 1.5 branch.
