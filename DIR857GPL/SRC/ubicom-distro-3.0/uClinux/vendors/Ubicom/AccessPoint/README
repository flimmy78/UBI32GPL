Here is a brief introduction to AccessPoint profile.

AccessPoint profile can be used to build a WiFi Access Point. It can
support multiple radios.

Currently, Atheros based 11n and legacy 11g radios are supported with
Fusion 7.3.0.x based drivers.

The profile configuration is optimized for dual radio performance with
pre-built wireless modules.

There is no supported UI for this profile. All configuration and
management has to be done through the console.
There is, however, a sample UI framework in /home/httpd.

At boot, only LAN is active. On boards with Ethernet switches, all switch
ports are on the LAN. Default IP address is 192.168.0.240. 

WLAN is not active at boot time. There are 2 helper scripts that can start the WLAN up.
/etc/ath/apup can be used to start a single radio.
/etc/ath/dual_apup can be used to start two radios.

There are 2 configuration files.
/etc/ap_config file includes configuration parameters that apply to the
whole Access Point operation. These include IP address, Version etc. 
/etc/ath/apcfg file includes configuration parameters that apply to
wireless configuration. Please see Atheros documentation for parameter
descriptions.
Both of these files will be stored in resilient flash so settings can be
recovered after a reboot.
